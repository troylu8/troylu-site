<h1>Hey!!</h1>
<p>
    I'm a computer science student who isn't afraid to learn new things.
</p>
<p>
    Full-stack web development is what excites me the most. <br>
    Check out the cool things I've built over at #projects!
</p>
<p>
    Recently, I've been getting really into jpop music. <br>
    It's full of energy in a unique way.
